# CafeBlog-Project
This project is a cafe blog created as part of my learning in web development. It was one of my first projects and I developed it to practice my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills.

The website features a fully responsive design to adapt to mobile devices, tablets and desktop computers. In addition, the project features an interactive form and blog articles related to coffee.
